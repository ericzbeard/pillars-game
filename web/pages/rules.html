    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        In this game, you are the newly minted owner of a technology company in the early phases of
        bringing a new product to market. You have made the wise choice to build your product on
        Amazon Web Services (AWS). You will have to make critical decisions about the resources that
        you acquire and employ to build out your company and beat the competition.
    </p>

    <p>
        AWS Build is a deckbuilding game that is based on AWS, a cloud computing environment where
        developers can choose from a variety of services to build applications of all shapes and
        sizes. In this game, you will craft a deck by acquiring resources that allow you to face
        trials that are common to all growing companies.
    </p>

    <h2>Pillars</h2>

    <p>
        The 5 pillar cards represent the pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. These cards
        are used to track experience during the game. Each player starts the game with a 6-sided die
        on 1 on each pillar. As the game progresses, players will be able to promote their pillars
        until they are “maxed out”. In a normal game, experience dice max out at 6, but in your
        first few games it is recommended to max out at 4. A maxed pillar die cannot be demoted for
        any reason, no matter what any card might instruct.</p>
    <p>
        The game ends when each pillar has at least one maxed out die. It doesn’t matter which
        player each die belongs to, as long as each pillar has a 6 (or whatever number has been
        designated as “max”). When the end-game condition is met, the current round of turns is
        completed so that each player ends the game having played the same number of turns.
        Each player starts with a d6 on 1 on each pillar at the beginning of the game. No player’s
        pillar die can be demoted below 1. If a die on 1 is demoted, it has no effect.
        Once a die reaches its “max” (usually 6), it is locked in. Nothing can demote it.</p>

    <h2>The Market</h2>
    <p>
        Resource cards are shuffled together and then 7 of those cards are placed face-up on the
        board into what is called the Market. These are the cards that players can acquire during
        their turns in order to improve their decks. The rest of the resource cards are placed in a
        face down stack near the Market. Make sure you don’t confuse this stack with your own deck!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are always 7 cards face-up in the market. Whenever a player acquires a card, it is
        immediately replaced from the Market deck before any further decisions must be made by any
        player.
        If the Market cards are exhausted, it represents an alternate end-game condition. The game
        ends and each player finishes their turn, just as if the pillars had all been maxed as
        described in the section on Pillars.</p>
    <p>
        At the end of any turn, after a player draws their new hand, if that player did not acquire
        any resources from the marketplace, the next player may reset the marketplace before their
        turn. To reset the marketplace, shuffle all cards from the marketplace into the market stack
        and re-populate the marketplace with 7 cards.</p>


    <h2>Cards</h2>
    <p>There are 3 main types of cards</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pillars</li>
        <li>Resources</li>
        <li>Trials (Phase 1, 2, and 3)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resource Cards</h3>
    <p>The cards that make up player’s decks, and the Market, are Resource cards. There are 5
        types of Resource cards.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Human Resources</li>
        <li>Cloud Resources</li>
        <li>Bugs</li>
        <li>Actions</li>
        <li>Events</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cloud Categories</h3>
    <p>Cloud Categories do not have any effect on game play. They do, however, count towards
        bonus conditions that can earn a large number of customers at the end of the game, so it
        pays off to keep them in mind when acquiring resources!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Analytics</li>
        <li>Integration</li>
        <li>Compute</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>Storage</li>
        <li>AI/ML</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Management</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Players can play as many resource cards from their hand as they want during their turn,
        in any order. Cards do not have any effect unless they are in play. Any cards left in
        hand when the player faces the trial at the end of turn have no effect and are discarded
        at the end of the turn.</p>

    <h3>Credits, Talent, and Creativity</h3>

    <p>Resource cards provide the fundamental currency that is used to acquire more resource
        cards and face trials.</p>

    <h4>Creativity</h4>
    <p>Creativity is used to face trials. The amount of Creativity in play is added to a
        player’s
        dice roll.</p>

    <h4>Credits</h4>
    <p>Credits are used to acquire basic resources.</p>

    <h4>Talents</h4>
    <p>Talents are used to acquire advanced resources, often in combination with Credits.</p>

    <h3>Augments</h3>
    <p>Some Resource cards are Augments—they only provide a benefit when they have a Resource to
        improve, such as a Human or Cloud Resource.</p>

    <h3>Trading</h3>
    <p>You can trade 4 of any one resource ($, T, Cr) for 1 of any other resource. For example,
        if
        you have 4 extra Credits that you can’t or don’t want to spend, you can turn it into 1
        Creativity.</p>

    <h3>Trials</h3>
    <p>At the end of each turn, players must face a trial. Trials are divided into 3 decks
        according to Phases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1—Development lasts until a player has 12 total experience on their pillars
        <li>Phase 2—Beta Testing lasts from 12 to 17 experience
        <li>Phase 3—Production begins when a player has at least 18 experience
    </ul>
    <p>Each player advances to Phase 2 and 3 independently.</p>
    <p>If a player’s pillars are demoted under the threshold for a Phase, that player goes back
        to
        the prior Phase.</p>
    <p>When facing a trial, players roll 2d6 (Two 6-sided dice). The total of those dice is added to
        the number of Creativity played that turn.</p>
    <p>In the below example, the player is facing a Phase 1 Trial that requires 7 Creativity to
        succeed. The player has a single card in play that provides Creativity—the Cloud Support
        card. The player rolls a 6, adds 1 Creativity from the Cloud Support card, and equals the
        number needed to pass the trial.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether a trial is defeated or not, it goes to the bottom of the trial deck
        face up. When there are no more face-down cards in the trial deck for that phase, the deck
        is shuffled.</p>

    <h3>The Starting Deck</h3>
    <p>All players start the game with an identical 12-card deck. At the beginning of the game,
        players shuffle their decks and draw their starting hand before the first turn is played. A
        player’s hand size is 6. Player’s begin the game with 6 cards in hand. Players discard any
        unused cards and draw 6 at the end of each turn (unless instructed to draw a different
        number of cards). The starting deck consists of these relatively weak cards:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>3 EC2 Instances (Provide 1 Credit)
        <li>3 Software Developers (Provide 1 Credit)
        <li>2 Cloud Support (Provide 1 Creativity)
        <li>1 Sandbox Credit (Adds a Credit if you have a Cloud Resource in play)
        <li>1 Training (Adds a Talent if you have a Human Resource in play)
        <li>1 Decommission (Trash a card or trash this card and add a Credit)
        <li>1 Promotion (Promote a Pillar)
    </ul>

    <h4>Turn Order</h4>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Play resource cards in any order and acquire resources.</strong> Acquired
            resources go to your discard pile unless the card gives different directions</li>

        <li><strong>Face a trial.</strong> Anything left in your hand can’t be used after you
            reveal the trial, so be sure to play your Creativity cards! Roll 2 6-sided dice. Add
            that number to the total Creativity on the cards you played this turn. If the number
            if equal to or greater than the number printed on the trial, you have succeeded!
            Follow the Success instructions on the card. Otherwise, you must follow the Failure
            instructions on the card.</li>

        <li>Put all played cards and cards left in hand into your discard pile.</li>

        <li>Place the trial face up on the bottom of the trial stack. Once you run out of face
            down trial cards, reshuffle the pile.</li>

        <li>Draw a new hand of 6 cards.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Customers</h3>

    <p>At the end of the game, the player with the most customers wins. Customers are gained by
        facing and succeeding against trials. Bonus customers are awarded at the end of the game
        for
        meeting certain conditions.</p>

    <h3>Bonus Customers</h3>

    <p>At the end of the game, each player gains customers if these conditions are met. Each
        card counts towards only one bonus.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>+3 customers for 5 different cloud resource categories</li>
        <li>+10 customers for all 10 cloud resource categories</li>
        <li>+2 customers for each pair of cards in a single cloud resource category</li>
        <li>+3 customers for each maxed pillar</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each player gets a reference card with the bonuses to use as a reminder during the game.
    </p>

    <h4>Number of Players</h4>
    <p>This game supports 2-4 players.</p>

    <h3>Discard</h3>
    <p>
        Discard means taking a card from your hand (one that you have not played this turn) and
        placing it into your Discard pile.
    </p>

    <h3>Retire</h3>
    <p>
        When a card is retired, it is removed from the game completely. Put it back in the box
        or
        set it aside so that it does not have any effect until your next game.
    </p>

    <h3>Acquire</h3>
    <p>
        When you acquire a card from the Market, place it into your Discard pile unless the card
        instructs otherwise. You do not immediately get the cards effect when you acquire it.
    </p>

    <h3>Auctions</h3>
    <p>
        Some very powerful resource cards have the word “Auction” on them. This means when you
        decide to buy it on your turn, other players can try to outbid you. In turn order, each
        player has an opportunity to bid higher, according to the Auction resource type. For
        example, if a card has a price of $$$TT and “Auction $”, players must bid extra $ over
        the
        price of the card. The first bid would need to be $$$$TT, the next bid would need to be
        $$$$$TT, etc. This continues until no player wants to outbid. Once a player passes, they
        cannot re-enter bidding.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the active player is outbid, they can spend their resources on new cards from the
        marketplace. The player who outbid them, however, must discard the resources used to
        outbid,
        which means they will be at a disadvantage during their next turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Length</h3>

    <p>A typical game will last approximately 90 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Bugs</h3>

    <p>
        Bugs are terrible cards that you put into an opponent’s discard pile after you acquire
        them
        (which makes their deck worse). Bugs can be retired by paying a penalty of some kind.
    </p>

    <h3>Starter Game</h3>

    <p>
        When just starting out, make the following changes to the rules in order to keep things
        simple and shorten the game length.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Remove all Auction cards from the Resource deck</li>
        <li>Pillars “max out” at 4 rather than 6</li>
        <li>Ignore the cloud resource categories and do not count up bonuses at the end of game
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tiebreaker</h3>

    <p>
        If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most maxed pillars wins the game. If
        there is
        still a tie, the tied players share the victory!
    </p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

    <strong>Can we play with less than 4 players?</strong>
    <p>
        Yes, 2 and 3 player games work just fine. Remember to separate out the starter cards and
        do
        not shuffle them into the marketplace deck
    </p>

    <strong>When do I shuffle my discard pile into my deck?</strong>
    <p>
        You shuffle the discard pile into your deck when you need to draw a card from your deck
        but
        it is empty. For example, at the end of your turn, you need to draw 6 cards, but there
        are
        only 4 cards remaining. Draw those 4 cards, then shuffle up your discard pile and draw 2
        more.
    </p>

    <strong>When I acquire a new card, do I get to play its effect immediately?</strong>
    <p>
        No, unless otherwise stated on the card, you always put acquired cards into your discard
        pile. You won’t get to play it until later, when the discard pile gets shuffled after
        you
        run out of cards to draw from your deck.
    </p>

    <strong>What happens if a pillar rank gets demoted, but it is already on 1?</strong>
    <p>Pillar ranks can’t go below 1. The demotion has no effect.</p>

    <strong>What happens if I fail a trial and lose a customer, but I have zero
        customers?</strong>
    <p>You stay at zero customers (you can’t go negative).</p>

    <strong>What’s the difference between a card that says “Promote” and a card that says
        “Promote I”?</strong>
    <p>
        Just the word “Promote” means roll a 6-sided die and promote that pillar. On a 6, you
        get to
        choose. The same goes for “Demote”. If you roll a 6 on a Demote, you can choose a pillar
        that’s already at 1, which means it will have no effect. “Promote I” means to promote
        pillar
        I. If it’s already maxed, there is no effect.
    </p>

    <strong>Why are Bugs bad, and why do I want to put them into my opponent’s discard
        pile?</strong>
    <p>
        Bugs are bad because they don’t do anything positive. They clog up your opponent’s deck
        with
        wasted space, and your opponent will have to do something detrimental to Retire the Bug
        from
        their deck.
    </p>
