# Pillars of AWS Game (aka AWS Build)

This project has the backend and a web canvas UI for the AWS Deck Building game "AWS Build", codename "Pillars".

It uses CDK for infrastructure deployment, Typescript as the default language, Lambda and API Gateway for the REST API, and DynamoDB for data storage.

This project is a prototype, with everything in one repo. Eventually we'll want to split out the web project and figure out what to do with shared resources like cards and game-state.

npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g browserify
